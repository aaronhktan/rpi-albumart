Show album art from the currently playing track according to Last.fm. Or, if you're not listening to anything, show albums listened to in the last week. Inspired by [Jason Tate's Now Playing Project](https://chorus.fm/news/now-playing-my-raspberry-pi-weekend-project/).

# Required Hardware
- **Raspberry Pi Zero, first-gen** (should work on other Pis as well but have not tested)
- **[Hyperpixel 4.0 Square Touch](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hyperpixel-4-square?variant=30138251444307)**
- **[3D-printed enclosure by Printminion](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4536253)**

# Build and Run
## Prereqs:
- Run the [Hyperpixel setup scripts](https://github.com/pimoroni/hyperpixel4) on the Raspberry Pi.
- In order to cross-compile for the Raspberry Pi Zero, you may need the appropriate compiler. On Debian-based Linux distros, you should run:
```
sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
```
- You will also need to download Raspberry Pi tools.
```
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools
```
- Finally, add the file `.cargo/config` with the following content:
```
[target.arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf]
linker = "<PATH_TO_PI_TOOLS>/arm-bcm2708/arm-rpi-4.9.3-linux-gnueabihf/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc"
```

## Build:
```
cargo build --release --target arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
```

The release binary will be in the `target/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release` directory.

## Run:
- **On the Raspberry Pi**, create a directory where you'll copy over the files.
```
cd ~/Documents && mkdir rpi-albumart
```
- **From the Linux computer where you built the binary**, copy the binary over to the Raspberry Pi.
```
scp ./target/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release/rpi-albumart pi@<PI_IP_ADDRESS_HERE>:~/Documents/rpi-albumart
```
- Copy over the templates directory.
```
scp -r ./templates pi@<PI_IP_ADDRESS_HERE>:~/Documents/rpi-albumart
```
- Copy over the static directory.
```
scp -r ./static pi@<PI_IP_ADDRESS_HERE>:~/Documents/rpi-albumart
```
- **On your Raspberry Pi**, run the binary!
```
./rpi-albumart
```
- If everything worked, you should see the following:
```
ðŸ›°  Routes:
   >> (hello) GET /?<user>&<key>
   >> (FileServer: static/) GET /static/<path..> [10]
ðŸ‘¾ Catchers:
   >> (not_found) 404
ðŸ“¡ Fairings:
   >> Templating (ignite, liftoff)
   >> Shield (liftoff, response, singleton)
ðŸš€ Rocket has launched from http://0.0.0.0:8000
```
- Visit `localhost:8000/?user=<LAST_FM_USERNAME>&key=<LAST_FM_API_KEY>` in the browser!

## Autostart

- Add a script called `launch.sh` at the root of this repository, with the following contents.
```
#!/bin/bash

# Working directory must be root of this repository,
# so that static files can be served.
# Put the absolute path! This script may be called
# as another user.
cd <PATH_TO_REPOSITORY>
./rpi-albumart
```
- To run this app on startup, create an autostart script on the Raspberry Pi.
```
cd ~
mkdir -p .config/lxsession/LXDE-pi
vim .config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
```
- Paste the following contents into the autostart script.
```
@lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
@pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
# disable blank screen
@xset s off
@xset -dpms
@xset s noblank
# launch binary
@sh <PATH_TO_REPOSITORY>/launch.sh
# wait for server to start
@sleep 30s
# launch chrome
/usr/bin/chromium-browser --kiosk --disable-restore-session-state http://localhost:8000/?user=<LAST_FM_USERNAME>&key=<LAST_FM_API_KEY>
# disable showing cursor
@unclutter -idle 0
@xscreensaver -no-splash
```
- Reboot, and then check the logs on the Raspberry Pi. You should see the same success message somewhere in the logs as when the binary was first run.
```
tail -n 200 ~/.cache/lxsession/LXDE-pi/run.log
```
